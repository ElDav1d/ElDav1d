### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David from Valencia (SPAIN) and I am a passionate Front End Engineer. Besides software craftsmanship, I also love making and listening music.

I consider myself a life-long learner.

Now Iâ€™m a React.js developer with the core fundamentals of JavaScript, providing resilient features with REST API on top. Yet I prefer discuss about programming good products, instead of what language or framework is the best.
