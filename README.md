# Hi there 👋, my name is David
### I'm a passionate Product Oriented Front End Engineer

🧱 ⚒️ 🖌 Besides software craftsmanship, I also love making and listening music.

📖 I consider myself a life-long learner.

⚛️ Now I’m a React.js developer with the core fundamentals of JavaScript, providing resilient features with REST API on top.

😄 Yet I prefer discuss about programming good products, instead of what language or framework is the best.
